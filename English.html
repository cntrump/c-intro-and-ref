<span id="Write-Programs-in-English_0021"></span><h3 class="section">5.1 Write Programs in English!</h3>

<p>In principle, you can write the function and variable names in a
program, and the comments, in any human language.  C allows any kinds
of characters in comments, and you can put non-ASCII characters into
identifiers with a special prefix.  However, to enable programmers in
all countries to understand and develop the program, it is best given
today&rsquo;s circumstances to write identifiers and comments in
English.
</p>
<p>English is the one language that programmers in all countries
generally study.  If a program&rsquo;s names are in English, most
programmers in Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, and Bulgaria can
understand them.  Most programmers in those countries can speak
English, or at least read it, but they do not read each other&rsquo;s
languages at all.  In India, with so many languages, two programmers
may have no common language other than English.
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t feel confident in writing English, do the best you can,
and follow each English comment with a version in a language you
write better; add a note asking others to translate that to English.
Someone will eventually do that.
</p>
<p>The program&rsquo;s user interface is a different matter.  We don&rsquo;t need to
choose one language for that; it is easy to support multiple languages
and let each user choose the language to use.  This requires writing
the program to support localization of its interface.  (The
<code>gettext</code> package exists to support this; see <a data-manual="libc" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Message-Translation.html#Message-Translation">The GNU C Library</a> in <cite>The GNU C Library Reference
Manual</cite>.)  Then a community-based translation effort can provide
support for all the languages users want to use.
